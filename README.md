# Leo's web site

My web site lives at https://duetosymmetry.com/. It is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), using Michael Rose's theme, [Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes).

I don't touch the master branch; instead, all of my commits go to my [customization branch](../../tree/customization).
