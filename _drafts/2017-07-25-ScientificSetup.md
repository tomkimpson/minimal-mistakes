>This post is an amalgamation of a couple of previous posts plus some new stuff re how to set up / use some useful software for scientific research on Linux. I will add to this post over time. It is naturally biased towards software I typically use in my research so lots of Fortran and Python!

Linuxbrew

gnuparallel


HDF

anaconda

Linux bits - e.g. ssh/ alias/path
