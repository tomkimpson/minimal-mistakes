At the British Museum there is a fantastic [Clocks and Watches Gallery](http://www.britishmuseum.org/visiting/galleries/europe/room_38-39_clocks_and_watches.aspx), which traces the evolution of timekeeping methods. It cumulates with a caesium atomic clock, which defines the second as 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation emitted during an transition between the two hyperfine ground states of caesium. The British Museum quotes the accuracy of this method as being in error of 1 second in ~ 60 million years, although [this excellent timeline from NPL](http://www.npl.co.uk/60-years-of-the-atomic-clock/timeline/) puts the most accurate caesium atomic clock as accurate to 1 second in 138 million years, as of 2011.

This is very impressive, however it is put to shame by the most accurate clock in nature: millisecond pulsars.

### Pulsars

When a very massive star, say 10 - 20 solar masses, collapses at the end of its life, it forms a neutron star. Such objects have a crystalline solid crust and a superfluid, liquid interior, composed of neutrons. As the neutron star rotates, it drags charged particles near its surface. These moving charges generate a strong magnetic field around the neutron star, and the neutron star emits a strong beam of radiation along its magnetic axis. This is a pulsar.


PICTURE - PULSAR

Now, we one see a pulsar when our line of sight intersects with the beamed radiation. As the pulsar rotates, we only see this radiation periodically, as a 'pulse' - hence the name.


An important property of pulsars is that they can be aged based on their pulse period. We can determine a pulsars age $$ \tau$$, by comparing its period $$ P$$ to the change in the period $$ \dot{P} $$

In the universe we can distinguish between two classes of pulsars: normal - those with pulse periods of ~1-10  seconds - and millisecond - those with millisecond periods. These two pulsar classes have different evolutionary histories. Normal pulsars form as described from the deaths of massive stars in supernovae explosions. This is consistent with where they are typically found; close to the galactic plane, in supernovae remnants (e.g. Crab pulsar). In contrast, MSPs are formed from the 'recycling' of a dead NS - (how exactly does this work?).















A clock is simply a system with some regular periodic occurrence. (X , Y and Z are all abstract clocks). The regular pulse from a pulsar therefore provides a clock with which we can keep time This regular pulse provides the 'tick' of the clock. The benchmark set by atomic clocks is accuracy to 1 second in ~ 100 million years. How do pulsars compare? 












are all neutron stars pulsars?
100 million vs 15 billion - why does it matter?
