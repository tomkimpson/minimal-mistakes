In Newtonian Mechanics the gravitational field produced by a body depends only on the mass of that body. However, in GR the spin of the body must also be considered as this spin causes the spacetime to be non-static.

Imagine we have some observer floating in space looking down at the Earth rotating below them. The angular velocity of this observer is,

$$ \Omega = \frac{d \phi}{dt} = \frac{u^{\phi}}{u^t}$$

Now, suppose the observer is stationary in their reference frame such that $$ u_{\phi} =0$$
