I recently came across a paper entitled ["Can one see the infinite future of the universe when falling to Kerr and Reissner-Nordstr√∂m black holes?"](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S020228931203005X). Unfortunately for those not on an academic network, the paper is hidden behind a pay-to-view wall, and no version is available on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org) (hopefully general open access [is coming soon](https://horizon-magazine.eu/article/research-papers-will-be-free-access-eventually-nature-s-philip-campbell_en.html))
