My current main interests are

* __Machine Learning__. ML refers to teaching a computer to learn concepts without being explicitly programmed. The Quora post ["How do I learn machine learning"](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-machine-learning-1) is an excellent resource, with over 100 answers. For the background theory, Andrew Ng's Stanford course is widely praised and [available free](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) on Coursera. Jason Brownlee also has a nice [collection of resources](http://machinelearningmastery.com/self-study-guide-to-machine-learning/) for progression from Beginner to Advanced.

* __Statistics, Game Theory, Probability__. At the moment I am working my way through [Bayesian methods for Hackers](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/blob/master/Chapter1_Introduction/Chapter1.ipynb), which is an awesome resource for doing any sort of Bayesian statistics in Python.
