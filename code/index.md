<b>From [Matt Might](http://matt.might.net/articles/crapl/): </b> <p><i> "Science thrives on openness.

In modern science, it is often infeasible to replicate claims without
access to the software underlying those claims.

Let's all be honest: when scientists write code, aesthetics and
software engineering principles take a back seat to having running,
working code before a deadline.

So, let's release the ugly.  And, let's be proud of that." </i> </p>

<b>Any scripts here are highly likely to be ugly</b>


<a href="https://github.com/tomkimpson/Fermi-MET-convertor">met_convertor.py</a>
Convertor which uses xTime from NASA's HEASARC to convert from calendar UTC time to mission elapsed MET time for the Fermi mission, which began 2001-01-01 00:00:00 UTC


<a href="https://github.com/tomkimpson/Kozai">Triple System Parameters</a> Script used to extract the orbital parameters and theoretical timescales from a data file giving masses/positions/velocities of a triple system evolving over time. 

<a href="https://github.com/tomkimpson/GCN">fetch_gcn.py</a>
Slightly cumbersome script which takes in a text file of links to GCN notices and outputs the RA/DEC/time of burst as recorded by Fermi-LAT.

<a href="https://github.com/tomkimpson/git-sh">run-git.sh</a> Very lazy script for pushing changes to github repo. Also useful to create local alias so this script can be run from any directory. [See here](http://tomkimpson.com/using-github.html) for github use and creating aliases

<a href="https://github.com/tomkimpson/doublependulum">double_pendulum.py</a> Script for integrating and then animating equations of motion of double pendulum

<a href="https://github.com/tomkimpson/sphericalpendulum">spherical_pendulum.py</a> Script for integrating and then animating equations of motion of double pendulum
