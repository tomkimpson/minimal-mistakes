###Intro
Our standard method of discourse for discussing ideas relies on the <b>axiomatic method</b> which requires both axioms and methods/rules:

-axiom - something we just assume to be true

-methods - set of rules that let us infer one statement from another.


So for example we might have a small system where the axioms are 'Monty is a man' and 'All men are mortal' and so use the rules to deduce that Monty is mortal.

###Application to Maths
Let's say we want to set up a mathematical language. We take a set of axioms and a set of rules and so deduce something that is true within this setup of axioms and rules. We might call this truth a 'theorem'. This is a very straightforward and deterministic process.


Now for a mathematic language or logical system to be useful we would require it to fulfill several conditions:

- <b>It must be consistent</b> - A sentence can't be proved to be both true and false

- <b>It must be complete</b> - For any sentence in the system we can prove it to be either true or false

- <b>It must be powerful</b> - The axioms and rules are well defined and easily followed through a deterministic system and must be able to express simple facts about simple numbers. 

###The Conclusion

Godel's incompleteness theorem is actually two theorems:

- <b>The First Theorem</b>: A system which is both powerful and consistent is not complete. i.e. there are statements which cannot be proved to be true or false - a powerful system must choose between being either consistent or complete.

- <b> The Second Theorem </b>: For a powerful system, it cannot prove its own consistency.

For those who have the inclination to work through the original paper [here it is](http://hirzels.com/martin/papers/canon00-goedel.pdf) for you.
