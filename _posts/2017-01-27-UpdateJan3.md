**Current issues**:

* From the Hamiltonian, how to arrive at the Euler-Lagrange equations? Two sub-problems here:

  * Uniform case: photons with different energies have different geodesics and so can we track pulsar signals by simply correlating wavelengths?

  * Non-uniform case: Cannot arrive at E-L equations through Carter's constant. Compare with de Broglie dispersion relation for massive particle.

* How to formulate a Hamiltonian for the non-'cold' case? Also turbulence effects?
