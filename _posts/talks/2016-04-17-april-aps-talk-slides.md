Here are [my slides]({{ site.url }}/files/extremal-BHs-in-dCS.pdf) and
movies (right click and save

[[2]]({{ site.url }}/files/theta.mp4))
from the 2016 April APS meeting in Salt Lake City, Utah.  This talk
was reporting on the work
[Extremal black holes in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /pubs/2015-12-17-extremal-black-holes-in-dynamical-chern-simons-gravity %})
done in collaboration with [Bob McNees](http://jacobi.luc.edu/) and
Nico Yunes.

Unfortunately, the APS presentation system choked on my slides.  Adobe
products don't seem to like some of the slides (I'm not going to spend
time trying to figure out why), but they work fine in Preview.app and
Skim.app (and presumably other PDF readers).  Nowadays we have the
internet so you can still enjoy my slides in the comfort of your own
home or office.
