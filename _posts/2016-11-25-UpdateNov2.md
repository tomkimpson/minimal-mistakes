>This is the first post in a series trialling the use of blogging for as a sort of done/ToDo list for my research.  Currently my desk is covered in papers/textbooks/notebooks and ideas/tasks often get lost in the mess. Hopefully this will help enforce a more efficent workflow.   


**Done**:

* Redshift of photons travelling emitted from NS in vicinity of massive Kerr BH.

* Parallelised (sp.?) intersection code

* Play with MPD code/maths


**ToDo():**

* More MPD code

* Covariant form of dispersion measure

* Consider how to speed up / fine tune intersection search. 



**Pic of the week**:
