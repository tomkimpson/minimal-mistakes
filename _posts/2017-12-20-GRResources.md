There is a vast collection of available resources for learning GR. These are some that I have found the most helpful.

* [Spacetime and Geometry, Sean Carrol](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/spacetimeandgeometry/)

This, in my opinion, is the best textbook for learning GR. I know others love MTW, but I find it slightly dated and tough going. The Carrol textbook, coversely, is clear, intuitive and all the good adjectives. Free notes are also available, but the book is well worth buying.


* [Christoper Pope's GR Notes](http://tomkimpson.com/pdfs/Pope_gravphysics.pdf)

* [Christopher Popes Geometry + Group Theory Notes](http://tomkimpson.com/pdfs/pope_grouptheory.pdf)

* [Alexander Hamilton's GR Notes](http://tomkimpson.com/pdfs/Hamilton_GR.pdf)

All of these are PDFs available online and express many of the same ideas as in Carrol, albeit in a slightly different form.
