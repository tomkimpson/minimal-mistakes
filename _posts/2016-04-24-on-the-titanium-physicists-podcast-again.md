Wow, Ben Tippet let me come back on his show,
[The Titanium Physicists Podcast](http://titaniumphysicists.brachiolopemedia.com/)!
Thanks, Ben. This time it's
[Episode 64: E and N (The edges of Einstein)](http://titaniumphysicists.brachiolopemedia.com/2016/04/25/episode-64-e-and-n-the-edges-of-einstein/)
along with Ben, science and technology writer
[Maya Inamura](https://mayainamura.contently.com/),
and fellow astrophysicist
[Katie Mack](http://www.astrokatie.com/).
Listen above or click through to Ben's site. We talked about
general relativity and how we know it's (basically) correct from
observations and experiments. It was super fun!
