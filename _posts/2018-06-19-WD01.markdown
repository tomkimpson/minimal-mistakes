  * **Nuclear Energy as a Green power source** - [Pinker](https://www.amazon.com/Enlightenment-Now-Science-Humanism-Progress/dp/0525427570)

    Nuclear energy is the world's most abundance and scalable carbon free energy source. Solar and wind currently provide on ~1.5 % of Earth's energy needs and are limited due to wind calming, sun setting etc. Whilst energy can be stored in batteries, not for the vast amounts of energy we are talking about. Plus wind + solar are not space dense; to keep up with the world's energy use requires covering an <div class="warning">area the size of Germany</div>  in wind turbines each year.

    In contrast, nuclear generates huge amounts of energy via $$E = mc^2$$. Uranium mining less impactful than coal/oil/gas and nuclear pants take up less space <div class="warning">(1/500 th)</div>  than wind or solar. Lower carbon footprint than all alternatives and safer: <div class="warning">kills 387 times more people</div>Coal per kWh of electricity generated. **Q: What about nuclear waste?**

    Nuclear energy is currently expensive due to primarily due to regulatory hurdles ( [~ $ 200 million per plant](https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/putting-nuclear-regulatory-costs-context/) ), whilst solar is cheap in part due to subsidies that [may be about to dry up](https://www.economist.com/business/2018/06/14/can-the-solar-industry-survive-without-subsidies). The is potential for new reactors to be installed on offshore cities (solving NIMBY problem), to be fuelled by abundant thorium or uranium extracted from seawater!

    The benefits of an energy source that is cleaner, denser, + cheaper than fossil fuels would be immense (think easy desalination of seawater.)

    <div class="warning">This will be a warning and it should be red!</div>

    some extra stuff

   * **Cooling the atmosphere by reducing solar radiation** - [Keith](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016EF000465%4010.1002/%28ISSN%292328-4277.GEOENGIN1)
   A solar geo-engineering method to reduce the effects of climate change by injecting the stratosphere with either sulphates (potentially problematic as they could produce sulphuric acid which damages the ozone layer) or [calcites](https://www.sciencealert.com/new-light-reflecting-particles-in-the-stratosphere-could-cool-earth-and-fix-the-ozone-layer). Rather than being a panacea to CO2 emissions and global warming, it would instead give some breathing space to keep the global temperature rise to within 2 degrees of pre-industrial levels, whilst methods to reduce and remove the quantity of CO2 in the atmosphere are developed.


   * **A quarter of the world's homicides take place in just four countries** - [UNODC](https://www.unodc.org/gsh/en/big-picture.html)
   These are Mexico, Columbia, Brazil and Venezuela. This is an interesting realisation that the distribution of homicides is highly lopsided. This skew is fractal in the sense that within a country most homicides occurs in a few cities, and within the city a few neighborhoods. This is in fact good news as it means that the rate of homicide can be drastically reduced by targeting just a few key areas. See e.g. [Instinto de Vida](https://www.instintodevida.org/) an attempt to halve homicide in Latin America within a decade.
