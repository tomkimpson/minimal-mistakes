I recently came across a paper, [Rothman, T. and Boughn, S. 2006](https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/0601043v3.pdf), which is now over a decade old, discussing the feasabiltiy of graviton detection. It was produced in reponse to a comment made by Freeman Dyson questioning whether it would ever be posssible to actually detect a gravtion.

In the expected quantum theory of gravity, the gravitational force will be quantized into particles called gravitons. In the same way that a photon mediates the electromagentic force, so will a graviton mediate the gravitational force. A (now decade old!) paper,  discusses the detectability of these theoretical particles, in response to Freeman Dysons question on whether it is concievable that any experiment could directly detect a gravtion. Below is summarized the trail of thought and conclusions from what is an interesting, and perhaps ultimatley depressing paper.


Imagine some detector of mass $$M_d$$ a distance $$ R$$ from a source - mass $$ M_s$$-of gravitons. The criterion for detecting a single graviton with a high probability is that the path length $$ \lambda$$ should be greater than the mean-free-path,

$$ \lambda > l$$

$$ n \sigma \lambda > 1$$

for density of particles in the detector $$n$$ and $$ \sigma$$ interaction cross section which quantifies the likelihood of a scattering event.

It can be shown (pg. 3) that this criterion approximatley reduces to,

$$ f_{\gamma} \sigma M_d \frac{M_s}{R^2} >1$$

This seems to make intutitive sense - we want the flux/cross-section and masses of the detector and source to be as large as possible, and also want to minimize the distance between the source and detector.


**Cross section**
As stated, the cross section $$ \sigma$$ is an effective area that sets how likely it is that a scattering event will take place when a beam is incident on an object composed of particles. It can also be thought of as the _rate_ of an event; high cross section, high rate of scattering. This is a scalar quantity. Typically in physics we talk of the differential cross section $$ d \sigma /d\Omega$$ which tells us the rate of scattering at a given angle ($$ \Omega$$ here is the [solid angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_angle) ). We can define this basically as,

$$ d \sigma = \frac{P}{I}$$

for power absobed by detector $$P$$ and flux $$ I$$. Now, it can be seen that,

$$ P = \hbar \omega \Gamma$$

where $$ \Gamma$$ is the transition rate given by [Fermi's golden rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi's_golden_rule)

$$\Gamma = \frac{2\pi}{\hbar} |<a|H|b>|^2 \rho $$

From here it is possible to show (pg 7 - 10) that for gravitons,

$$ \simga = \hbar G$$

i.e. some very small quantity.


**Graviton luminosity**

There are few feasible sources of gravitons. These include


sources:
i) spontaneous emission - impossible
ii) BH decay
iii) gravitational bremsstrahulung
iv) Gertsenshtein


gravtions per cubic wavelengths

neutrin noise and shield.
