I recently came across a paper, [Rothman, T. and Boughn, S. 2006](https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/0601043v3.pdf), which is now over a decade old, discussing the feasibility of graviton detection. It was produced in response to a comment made by Freeman Dyson questioning whether it would ever be possible to actually detect a graviton.

In the expected quantum theory of gravity, the gravitational force will be quantized into particles called gravitons. In the same way that a photon mediates the electromagnetic force, so will a graviton mediate the gravitational force. A (now decade old!) paper,  discusses the detectability of these theoretical particles, in response to Freeman Dyson's question on whether it is conceivable that any experiment could directly detect a graviton. Below is summarized the trail of thought and conclusions from what is an interesting, and perhaps ultimately depressing paper.


Imagine some detector of mass $$M_d$$ a distance $$ R$$ from a source - mass $$ M_s$$-of gravitons. The criterion for detecting a single graviton with a high probability is that the path length $$ \lambda$$ should be greater than the mean-free-path,

$$ \lambda > l$$

$$ n \sigma \lambda > 1$$

for density of particles in the detector $$n$$ and $$ \sigma$$ interaction cross section which quantifies the likelihood of a scattering event.

It can be shown (pg. 3) that this criterion approximately reduces to,

$$ f_{\gamma} \sigma M_d \frac{M_s}{R^2} >1$$

This seems to make intuitive sense - we want the flux/cross-section and masses of the detector and source to be as large as possible, and also want to minimize the distance between the source and detector.


### Cross section
As stated, the cross section $$ \sigma$$ is an effective area that sets how likely it is that a scattering event will take place when a beam is incident on an object composed of particles. It can also be thought of as the _rate_ of an event; high cross section, high rate of scattering. This is a scalar quantity. Typically in physics we talk of the differential cross section $$ d \sigma /d\Omega$$ which tells us the rate of scattering at a given angle ($$ \Omega$$ here is the [solid angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_angle) ). We can define this basically as,

$$ d \sigma = \frac{P}{I}$$

for power absorbed by detector $$P$$ and flux $$ I$$. Now, it can be seen that,

$$ P = \hbar \omega \Gamma$$

where $$ \Gamma$$ is the transition rate given by [Fermi's golden rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi's_golden_rule)

$$\Gamma = \frac{2\pi}{\hbar} |<a|H|b>|^2 \rho $$

From here it is possible to show (pg 7 - 10) that for gravitons,

$$ \simga = \hbar G$$

i.e. **some very small quantity**.

With this cross section we are now in a position to determine how likely we are to detect a graviton in different physical situations. We take our detector mass $$ M_d$$ detector to be equal to that of Jupiter, $$ \sim 10^{27}$$ kg, and composed entirely of atomic hydrogen.



### Graviton luminosity

There are few feasible sources of gravitons. We consider each mechanism and the likelihood of graviton detection via this mechanism (see pg 11 onwards.)

**i) Spontaneous Emission**
There are two sub-mechanisms to consider here. One is direct spontaneous emission, where a graviton is emitted spontaneously in the decay of a hydrogen atom from the *3d* to the *1s* state (*Personal note: why should this be true?*). In this case the emitted graviton would have insufficient energy to ionize any of the hydrogen in our Jupiter-mass detector. The second is a gravitational analogue of the [Compton effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton_scattering), where a graviton is scattered off an electron and we use our detector to detect the electrons recoil energy. In this case, even if we take the source mass to be equal to the mass of the galaxy ($$ \sim 10^{42}$$ kg) and assume that the source - detector separation $$ R \sim 30$$ kpc, the detection criterion is not satisfied. Consequently it is concluded that the detection of gravitons from spontaneous emission is impossible.

**iii) Gravitational Bremsstrahlung**

Does this mean we can never detect gravitons?
