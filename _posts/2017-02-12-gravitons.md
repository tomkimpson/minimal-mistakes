I recently came across a paper, [Rothman, T. and Boughn, S. 2006](https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/0601043v3.pdf), which is now over a decade old, discussing the feasabiltiy of graviton detection. It was produced in reponse to a comment made by Freeman Dyson questioning whether it would ever be posssible to actually detect a gravtion.

In the expected quantum theory of gravity, the gravitational force will be quantized into particles called gravitons. In the same way that a photon mediates the electromagentic force, so will a graviton mediate the gravitational force. A (now decade old!) paper,  discusses the detectability of these theoretical particles, in response to Freeman Dysons question on whether it is concievable that any experiment could directly detect a gravtion. Below is summarized the trail of thought and conclusions from what is an interesting, and perhaps ultimatley depressing paper.


Imagine some detector of mass $$M_d$$ a distance $$ R$$ from a source - mass $$ M_s$$-of gravitons of energy $$ \epsilon_{\gamma}$$.  The criterion for detecting a single graviton with a high probability is that the path length $$ \lambda$$ should be greater than the mean-free-path,

$$ \lambda > l$$

$$ n \sigma \lambda > 1$$

for density of particles in the detector $$n$$ and $$ \sigma$$ interaction cross section which quantifies teh likelihood of a scattering event.

It can be shown, assuming a detector made entirely from atomic hydrogen, (pg. 3) that this criterion reduces to,

$$ \frac{f_{\gamma} \sigma}{4 \pi} \frac{M_d}{\m_p} \frac{M_s}{R^2} \frac{1}{\epsilon_{\gamma}} >1$$


In the paper they take a detector at the maximum theoretical mass at which the gravtitaional and electrostatic forces are balanced. This produces a detector with a mass rougghly equivalent to that of Jupiter. This detector would work by detecting the recoil electron energy due to gravito-Compton scattering, an effect entirely analogus to electromagnetic [Compton scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton_scattering), where the photon is subsitituted for a graviton.


Now, of primary interest is It can be shown that the average cross section for such an interaction would be $$ \sigma_{av} \sim G \hbar$$
