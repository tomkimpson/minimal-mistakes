**Done**:

* Determined the equations of motion for propagation through a homogeneous plasma in a curved Kerr spacetime.


**ToDO()**:

* Implement new equations of motion into code - play with changing the refractive index

* Consider inhomogeneous case. Discuss with Kinwah/Sylvia - hwo to get around equations becoming non-separable?

* Prep presentation for first panel meet.

* Consider and compare micro and macro explanations for dispersion i.e. what happens to the wave vs. what hapens to an individual photon?
