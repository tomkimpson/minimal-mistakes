**Done**:

* Majority of MPD code

* Progress on covariant form of dispersion measure


**ToDo():**

* Ensure BH masses used in MPD and ray tracing are the same

* Think about how to match photon trajectory to Pulsar angle.

* Finer details of MPD, including:
    
    * What sort of NS orbit do we want to model?

    * Theoretical points: multipole expansion of energy momentum tensor (see DIXON), Moller radius, MPD condition where M << m is not always true, physically understanding the spin tensor, why is the dipole-dipole interaction weaker?

* Further work on covariant form of dispersion measure.

* Ensure officail log and notes up to date.
