>This is the first post in a series trialling the use of blogging for as a sort of done/ToDo list for my research.  Currently my desk is covered in papers/textbooks/notebooks and ideas/tasks often get lost in the mess. Hopefully this will help enforce a more efficent workflow.   


**Done**:

* Determine the orbital motion of a particle (non-spinning) in Kerr Spacetime.

* Ray trace of photon trajectories from image plane towards Kerr BH.

* Search and find intersection of particle with photon trajectory, so as to obtain location on image plane.


**ToDo():**

* Code for MPD equations. This will allow simulation of spinning particle in Kerr ST, accounting for spin-curvature coupling. Particle is taken as test particle. See "Fast spinning Pulsars as Probes of Massive Black Holes gravity" and "Mathisson-Papapetrou Dixon equations in the Schwarzchild and Kerr backgrounds". **This is the primary task**

* Clean up use of OpenMP for running in parallel and stress test intersection code (cross.f)

* Further background/notes on SKA/eLISA/MPD etc. Some papers to consult:SKA-Japan Pulsar Science with the SKA (Takahashi), Testing gravity with Pulsars in the SKA era (Shao), Pulsar Science with the SKA (Kramer).
