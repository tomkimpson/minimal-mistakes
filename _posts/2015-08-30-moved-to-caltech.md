My first postdoc has wrapped up after three productive years at
Cornell as a NASA Einstein postdoctoral fellow.  In September of 2015,
I am starting my second postdoctoral position, as a senior
postdoctoral researcher in the [TAPIR](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/
"Theoretical astrophysics including relativity") group at
[Caltech](http://www.caltech.edu/) (my undergraduate alma mater!). I'm
looking forward to finishing up old projects, starting new ones, and
interacting with everyone who works at or comes to visit Caltech. Drop
me a line if you're near Pasadena!
