Yesterday, I hosted a
[Quora session on gravitational waves](https://www.quora.com/profile/Leo-C-Stein/session/90/)
and a bunch of other topics (LIGO, black holes, and more). I think it
went pretty well! I answered about 25 questions and received (so far)
about 40,000 views. Some of the answers have also been republished
[at the Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/quora/do-scientist-doubt-the-de_b_9266010.html). I
hope this got more people interested in gravitational waves!
