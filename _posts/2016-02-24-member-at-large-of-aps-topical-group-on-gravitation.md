The election for APS's topical group on gravitation (GGR)
[has concluded](http://apsggr.org/?p=328), and I have been elected as
one of the new members-at-large!  Thanks to everyone who voted. I will
take my new responsibilities seriously and give back to our community
as best I can. Congratulations to the other newly-elected executive
committee members: vice chair,
[Emanuele Berti](http://www.phy.olemiss.edu/~berti/); member-at-large,
[Kelly Holley-Bockelmann](http://astro.phy.vanderbilt.edu/~holleyjk/Site/);
and student member-at-large,
[Megan Jones](http://graduate.wvu.edu/fellowship-profiles/megan-jones). See
you all in April!
