### 1.1 Origins
The origin of special relativity is a set of paradoxes discovered during the pioneering days in the study of electromagnetism (EM). <br> <br> It was found empirically that (Ampere's Law),

$$ \nabla \times \vec{B} = \mu_0 \vec{J} $$

However, this equation could not be wholly correct. By vector calculus

 $$\nabla \cdot(\nabla \times \vec{B})=0$$

 whilst the conservation of charge requires the continuity equation

$$ \nabla \cdot J = - \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} $$

Taking the divergence of Ampere's law, along with the continuity equation and Gauss' Law $$\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = \rho/\epsilon_0$$ then leads to,

$$ \nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \vec{B}) = \nabla \cdot ( \mu_0 \vec{J}) = - \nabla \cdot (\mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial E}{\partial t})$$

which is in conflict with the original vector calculus requirement. <br> <br> This lead to Maxwell modifying Ampere's equation as:

$$ \nabla \times \vec{B} = \mu_0 \vec{J} + \mu_o \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} $$

From Maxwell's equations it is simple to show that $$ E$$ and $$ B$$ both satisfy the wave equation,

$$ \nabla^2 f = \frac{1}{v^2} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial t^2} $$

such that

$$ v = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \epsilon_0}} =  c $$

This is a key insight: **in a vacuum EM waves always travel at $$c$$**.

### 1.2 Basics

Quick overview of basic SR/GR terminology:

* Inertial Frame: Frame of reference travelling at a constant velocity.

* Galilean transformation: 'common sense' transformation i.e. $$ x = x' +vt$$

* Invariant Interval: invariant 'distance' between two events in spacetime. Taking the form of the metric to be [-+++],

$$ ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + dx^2 +dy^2 +dz^2 = g_{ab} dx^a dx^b$$

### 1.3 The Postulates of Special Relativity

Special relativity rests on two key assumptions:

* Principle of relativity

* Invariance of $$ c$$.

These assumptions mandate that Galilean transformations no longer apply between inertial frames. Instead we use the linear Lorentz transformations,

$$ F' = L F$$

For frame $$F'$$ moving with velocity $$v$$ along the shared $$x'-x$$ axis, the *L* transformation matrix is,

$$ L =
\begin{bmatrix}
cosh \phi & -sinh \phi & 0 & 0 \\
-sinh \phi & cosh \phi & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1  
\end{bmatrix}$$

where

$$ \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}} = cosh \phi \, \, ; \beta = \frac{v}{c}$$


The Lorentz transformations have two physical consequences:

* Time dilation: For frame F' moving at velocity w.r.t frame F, an interval as measured by an observer in F' is seen in F as

$$ \Delta t = \gamma \Delta t'$$

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i.e. the clock of F' runs slower

* Length contraction:

$$ \Delta x' = \gamma \Delta x$$

* Velocity addition:

$$ v_3 = \frac{v_1 + v_2}{1 + v_1v_2/c^2}$$

### 1.4 Four-Vectors
Some important 4-vectors and quantities:

* 4-velocity:

$$ \vec{u} = \frac{d \vec{x}}{d \tau}$$

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for proper time $$ \tau$$.

* Energy,

$$ E = \gamma m_0 c^2$$

* 4-momentum,

$$ \vec{p} = \gamma m_0 \vec{u} = (E/c, p) \, ; \vec{p} \cdot \vec{p} = E^2/c^2 - p^2$$

* Relativistic mass,

$$ m = \gamma m_0 \approx m_0 + \frac{1}{2} m_0 \frac{v^2}{c^2}$$

and so

$$ mc^2 = m_0 c^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_0 v^2$$

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i.e. = rest mass + Newtonian K.E.
