>This is the first post in a series of posts trialling the use of blogging for condensing and collecting academic notes. The idea is to have a central collection of dynamic and interactive notes, i.e. notes that can be continually updated and edited and also that can have a structure that does not obstruct the main points being made. Often in traditional physics texts a long derivation can interrupt the trail of thought of the main topic. By having notes on a blog, extras such as derivations or miscellaneous points can be hosted and linked to as a separate blog post, in a Wikipedia style, without interrupting the overall structure. These are ** personal** notes and so I may skip over bits that I find straightforward yet others might find difficult, or labour on topics that someone might view as being easy and obvious.

### 1.1 Origins
The origin of special relativity is a set of paradoxes discovered during the pioneering days in the study of electromagnetism (EM).<br> <br>

It was found empirically that $$ \nabla \times \vec{B} = \mu_0 \vec{J}$$

However, this equation could not be wholly correct. By vector calculus $$\nabla \cdot(\nabla \times \vec{B})=0$$, whilst the conservation of charge requires the continuity equation

$$ \nabla \cdot J = - \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} $$

Taking the divergence of Ampere's law, along with the continuity equation and Gauss' Law $$\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = \rho/\epsilon_0$$ then leads to,

$$ \nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \vec{B}_ = \nabla \cdot ( \mu_0 \vec{J}) = - \nabla \cdot (\mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial E}{\partial t})$$
