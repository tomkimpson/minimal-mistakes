Current key task:

**Correct equations of motion for photon geodesic to account for dispersion effects as photon travels through an inhomogeneous, cold plasma - e.g. the ISM.**

This will require:

* Formulate a Hamiltonian with some dependence on the refractive index of the plasma $$n$$.

* Formulate an expression for the refractive index in terms of 4-vectors. In what case can we then relate this to the plasma frequency?

* Use the Hamiltonian and refractive index equation to determine equations of motion of a photon, accounting for dispersion. In the $$n=1$$ case we should obtain the original vacuum equations.
