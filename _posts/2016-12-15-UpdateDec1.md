**Done**:

* MPD code finalised

* General work on covariant dispersion form. Consult Melrose and consider what frames we are interested in.

* Method for matching photon trajectory to pulsar angle ( condition on area on the sphere defined by NS radius)


**ToDo():**

* Mathematics of matching photon trajectory to pulsar angle

* More covariant dispersion work

* Clarify long-term aims: suppose we can model and image emission from a spinning pulsar... so what?
