[GNU parallel](http://tomkimpson.com/gnuparallel/) is useful if you have $$ X$$ .sh scripts that need to be run in parallel across multiple cores. If instead we want to run the components of a single (Fortran) script in parallel, we can use [OpenMP](http://www.openmp.org).

Use is fairly straightforward - it is just important to define the variables used correctly. An example is presented below:

```fortran
PROGRAM demo
INTEGER I,J,
REAL r,theta,phi
character(len=100) :: xstr, ystr,loadfile


r=8
theta = 1.57
phi = 3.14

!$OMP PARALLEL DO PRIVATE(I,J,xstr,ystr,loadfile) SHARED(r,theta,phi)

do I = -5,5
   do J = -5,5
       write(xstr, '(F8.2)') REAL(I)
       write(ystr, '(F8.2)') REAL(J)
       loadfile = '/path/to/some/file/file='//trim(adjustl(xstr))//'_y='//trim(adjustl(ystr))//'.txt'

       call some_subroutine(loadfile,r,theta,phi)

enddo
enddo
!$OMP END PARALLEL DO

END
```

So all the stuff thats run in parallel is contained within the two ``` !$OMP``` statements. WE must also declare which variables are 'private' - i.e. used by only one strand - and which are 'shared'. In the example case, the values of $$ r, \theta, \phi$$ are the same for each strand. What is different is the load file and so the parameters related to the loadfile are declared as private.

Compilation is of the form,

```fortran
gfortran -fopenmp script.f
```
The number of strands to run is set externally as,

```
export OMP -NUM_THREADS=8
```

for setting e.g. 8 threads running in parallel.

Calling ``` nproc``` will confirm the number of threads that will be run, whilst ``` nproc --all``` will show you the total number of cores available to you.
