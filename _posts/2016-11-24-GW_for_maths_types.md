With the detection of the first gravitational waves by LIGO just over one year ago, there have been a plethora of great articles explaining gravitational waves to the layman. These are all excellent resources, but someone with a more maths-based background might find them lacking: questions such as **"Why does a spinning star not emit gravitational waves?"**, **"Why is the aplitude of gravitational waves so small"** or **"do gravitaional waves carry energy"** can only be properly explained with reference to the mathematics associated with the physics. Hopefully this post will help those with a stronger maths background gain a deeper understanding of one of the greatest empirical detections.

** Linearized theory**
At small scales we can consider space to be flat and described by the Minkowski metric $\nu_{ab}$. For our paedeological purposes, it will be sufficient to consider the linearized theory of gravitaional waves, and introduced a small perturbation $h_{ab}$ to the flat space, such that the total metric is,

$$ g_{ab}=\nu_{ab}+h_{ab}$$

This equation can be solved (long-ly and arduously, see MTW )
