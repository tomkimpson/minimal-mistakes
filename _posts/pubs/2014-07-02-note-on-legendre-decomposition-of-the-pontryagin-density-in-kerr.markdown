> In [arXiv:1406.0957v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0957) ("Scalar
> field excited around a rapidly rotating black hole in Chern-Simons
> modified gravity"), Konno and Takahashi have recently developed some
> analytical results for the scalar field about a Kerr black hole in
> the decoupling limit of dynamical Chern-Simons gravity. This
> involved a decomposition of the source (the Pontryagin density) in
> terms of Legendre polynomials. Here we give a two-line expression
> for this decomposition which simplifies their quadruple sum. Our
> expressions are rational polynomials multiplying Legendre functions
> of the second kind, or equivalently rational polynomials multiplying
> hypergeometric functions.
