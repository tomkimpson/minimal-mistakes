> We generalize the bumpy black hole framework to allow for
> alternative theory deformations. We construct two model-independent
> parametric deviations from the Kerr metric: one built from a
> generalization of the quasi-Kerr and bumpy metrics and one built
> directly from perturbations of the Kerr spacetime in
> Lewis-Papapetrou form. We find the conditions that these “bumps”
> must satisfy for there to exist an approximate second-order Killing
> tensor so that the perturbed spacetime still possesses three
> constants of the motion (a deformed energy, angular momentum and
> Carter constant) and the geodesic equations can be written in
> first-order form. We map these parametrized metrics to each other
> via a diffeomorphism and to known analytical black hole solutions in
> alternative theories of gravity. The parametrized metrics presented
> here serve as frameworks for the systematic calculation of extreme
> mass-ratio inspiral waveforms in parametrized non-general relativity
> theories and the investigation of the accuracy to which space-borne
> gravitational wave detectors can constrain such deviations.
