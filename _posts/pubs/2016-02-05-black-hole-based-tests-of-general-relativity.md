This is an invited review paper which was solicited for the CQG Focus
Issue
[Black holes and fundamental fields](http://iopscience.iop.org/0264-9381/focus/Focus%20issue%20on%20Black%20holes%20and%20fundamental%20fields),
guest edited by [Paolo Pani](http://paolopani.weebly.com/) and
[Helvi Witek](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/people/h.witek/).  Paolo and
Helvi, thanks for giving me and Kent the opportunity to contribute!

> General relativity has passed all Solar System experiments and
> neutron star based tests, such as binary pulsar observations, with
> flying colors. A more exotic arena for testing general relativity is
> in systems that contain one or more black holes. Black holes are the
> most compact objects in the universe, providing probes of the
> strongest-possible gravitational fields. We are motivated to study
> strong-field gravity since many theories give large deviations from
> general relativity only at large field strengths, while recovering
> the weak-field behavior. In this article, we review how one can
> probe general relativity and various alternative theories of gravity
> by using electromagnetic waves from a black hole with an accretion
> disk, and gravitational waves from black hole binaries. We first
> review model-independent ways of testing gravity with
> electromagnetic/gravitational waves from a black hole system. We
> then focus on selected examples of theories that extend general
> relativity in rather simple ways. Some important characteristics of
> general relativity include (i) only tensor gravitational degrees of
> freedom, (ii) the graviton is massless, (iii) no quadratic or higher
> curvatures in the action, and (iv) the theory is 4
> dimensional. Altering a characteristic leads to a different
> extension of general relativity: (i) scalar-tensor theories, (ii)
> massive gravity theories, (iii) quadratic gravity, and (iv) theories
> with large extra dimensions. Within each theory, we describe black
> hole solutions, their properties, and current and projected
> constraints on each theory using black hole-based tests of
> gravity. We close this review by listing some of the open problems
> in model-independent tests and within each specific theory.
