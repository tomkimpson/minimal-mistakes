> We study two large classes of alternative theories, modifying the
> action through algebraic, quadratic curvature invariants coupled to
> scalar fields. We find one class that admits solutions that solve
> the vacuum Einstein equations and another that does not. In the
> latter, we find a deformation to the Schwarzschild metric that
> solves the modified field equations in the small-coupling
> approximation. We calculate the event horizon shift, the innermost
> stable circular orbit shift, and corrections to gravitational waves,
> mapping them to the parametrized post-Einsteinian framework.
