This paper relied on proofs in papers which I had some difficulty
finding.  The more modern papers are available online:
[Alty, J. Math. Phys. <b>36</b>, 3094 (1995)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.531015)
and
[Gilkey and Park, J. Geom. Phys. <b>88</b> (2015)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomphys.2014.11.006).
However, I could not locate digital copies of the older papers of
[Avez, C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris <b>255</b> (1962)]({{ site.url }}/files/C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris 1962 Avez.pdf) and
[Chern, An. Acad. Brasil. Ci. <b>35</b> (1963)]({{ site.url }}/files/An. Acad. Brasil. Ci. 1963 Chern.pdf).
I was able to get hardcopies of these articles scanned, which are
the preceeding links.  Because of the difficulty involved in finding
these articles, I thought it would be helpful to others if I made them
available here.  Please contact me if you would like me to remove
these scans from my web site.
