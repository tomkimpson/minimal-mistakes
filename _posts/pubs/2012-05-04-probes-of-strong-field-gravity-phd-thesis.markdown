> In this thesis, I investigate several ways to probe gravity in the
> strong-field regime. These investigations focus on observables from
> the gravitational dynamics, i.e. when time derivatives are large:
> thus I focus on sources of gravitational waves. Extreme mass-ratio
> inspirals (EMRIs) can be very sensitive probes of strong-field
> physics. Predicting observables from EMRIs must be done numerically,
> so accurate numerical methods are required to ensure that any
> comparison with measurement is not spoiled by numerical
> artefacts. The first investigation of this thesis is a spectral (in
> the angular sector), pseudospectral (in the radial sector)
> time-domain PDE solver for perturbations of a Kerr black hole
> (i.e. solving the Teukolsky equation). The method exhibits good
> convergence and prompts much future investigation. A second approach
> to probing strong gravity is to consider theories which are general
> relativity (GR) with a few small corrections and investigate the
> effect of these corrections on observables. Since gravitational
> waves are the prime observable and they control the long-term
> evolution of dynamical systems, I investigate their properties in
> almost-GR theories. The second investigation of this thesis is a
> study of the propagation and energy content of gravitational waves
> in these theories. I find that in a large class of theories,
> approaching the asymptotically at part of spacetime, gravitational
> waves propagate in the same fashion as in GR and have the same
> effective stress-energy tensor as in GR. Next, I study the
> strong-field correction to the structure of a Schwarzschild black
> hole in a class of theories. Finally, with these ingredients, I
> investigate the leading corrections to the dynamics and observables
> of a comparable mass-ratio inspiral using post-Newtonian
> techniques. The main result is the appearance of dipolar scalar
> radiation in this class of theories. The dipolar radiation has a
> frequency dependence which does not arise in GR and is a distinct
> signature of corrections. Such signatures should be testable using
> gravitational wave detection and pulsar timing.
