> The sensitivity of current searches for gravitational-wave bursts is

> gravitational-wave signal. These techniques often fail in the
> presence of noise nonstationarities by incorrectly identifying such
> transients as possible gravitational-wave bursts. Furthermore,
> consistency tests currently used to try to eliminate these noise
> transients are not applicable to general networks of detectors with
> different orientations and noise spectra. In order to address this
> problem we introduce a fully coherent consistency test that is
> robust against noise nonstationarities and allows one to distinguish
> between gravitational-wave bursts and noise transients in general
> detector networks. This technique does not require any a priori
> knowledge of the putative burst waveform.
