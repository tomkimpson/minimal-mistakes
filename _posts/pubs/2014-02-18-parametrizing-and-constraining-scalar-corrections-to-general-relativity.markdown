> We parameterize a large class of corrections to general relativity
> which include a long-ranged gravitational scalar field as a
> dynamical degree of freedom in two ways: parameterizing the
> structure of the correction to the action, and parameterizing the
> scalar hair (multipole structure) that compact objects and black
> holes attain. The presence of this scalar hair violates the no-hair
> theorems present in general relativity, which leads to several
> important effects. The effects we consider are i) the interaction
> between an isolated body and an external scalar field, ii) the
> scalar multipole-multipole interaction between two bodies in a
> compact binary, iii) the additional pericenter precession of a
> binary, iv) the scalar radiation from a binary, and v) the
> modification to the gravitational wave phase from a binary. We apply
> this framework to example theories including
> Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and dynamical Chern-Simons
> gravity, and estimate the size of the effects. Finally we estimate
> the bounds that can be placed on parameters of the theories from the
> precession of pulsar binaries and from gravitational waves.
