A python implementation which generates slimplectic integrators is
available on github as
[slimplectic](https://github.com/davtsang/slimplectic).

> Symplectic integrators are widely used for long-term integration of
> conservative astrophysical problems due to their ability to preserve
> the constants of motion; however, they cannot in general be applied
> in the presence of nonconservative interactions. In this Letter, we
> develop the “slimplectic” integrator, a new type of numerical
> integrator that shares many of the benefits of traditional
> symplectic integrators yet is applicable to general nonconservative
> systems. We utilize a fixed-time-step variational integrator
> formalism applied to the principle of stationary nonconservative
> action developed in Galley et al. As a result, the generalized
> momenta and energy (Noether current) evolutions are well-tracked. We
> discuss several example systems, including damped harmonic
> oscillators, Poynting–Robertson drag, and gravitational radiation
> reaction, by utilizing our new publicly available code to
> demonstrate the slimplectic integrator algorithm. Slimplectic
> integrators are well-suited for integrations of systems where
> nonconservative effects play an important role in the long-term
> dynamical evolution. As such they are particularly appropriate for
> cosmological or celestial N-body dynamics problems where
> nonconservative interactions, e.g., gas interactions or dissipative
> tides, can play an important role.
