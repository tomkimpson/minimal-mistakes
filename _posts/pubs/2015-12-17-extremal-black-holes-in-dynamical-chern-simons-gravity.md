> Rapidly rotating black hole solutions in theories beyond general
> relativity play a key role in experimental gravity, as they allow us
> to compute observables in extreme spacetimes that deviate from the
> predictions of general relativity (GR).  Such solutions are often
> difficult to find in beyond-GR theories due to the inclusion of
> additional fields that couple to the metric non-linearly and
> non-minimally.  In this paper, we consider rotating black hole
> solutions in one such theory, dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, where
> the Einstein-Hilbert action is modified by the introduction of a
> dynamical scalar field that couples to the metric through the
> Pontryagin density.  We treat dynamical Chern-Simons gravity as an
> effective field theory and thus work in the decoupling limit, where
> corrections are treated as small perturbations from general
> relativity.  We perturb about the maximally-rotating Kerr solution,
> the so-called extremal limit, and develop mathematical insight into
> the analysis techniques needed to construct solutions for generic
> spin.  First we find closed-form, analytic expressions for the
> extremal scalar field, and then determine the trace of the metric
> perturbation, giving both in terms of Legendre decompositions.
> Retaining only the first three and four modes in the Legendre
> representation of the scalar field and the trace respectively
> suffices to ensure a fidelity of over 99% relative to full numerical
> solutions.  The leading-order mode in the Legendre expansion of the
> trace of the metric perturbation contains a logarithmic divergence
> at the extremal Kerr horizon, which is likely to be unimportant as
> it occurs inside the perturbed dynamical Chern-Simons horizon.  The
> techniques employed here should enable the construction of analytic,
> closed-form expressions for the scalar field and metric
> perturbations on a background with arbitrary rotation.
