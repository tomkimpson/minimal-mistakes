> Rapidly rotating black holes are a prime arena for understanding
> corrections to Einstein's theory of general relativity (GR). We
> construct solutions for rapidly rotating black holes in dynamical
> Chern-Simons (dCS) gravity, a useful and motivated example of a
> post-GR correction. We treat dCS as an effective theory and thus
> work in the decoupling limit, where we apply a perturbation scheme
> using the Kerr metric as the background solution. Using the
> solutions to the scalar field and the trace of the metric
> perturbation, we determine the regime of validity of our
> perturbative approach. We find that the maximal spin limit may be
> divergent, and the decoupling limit is strongly restricted for rapid
> rotation. Rapidly-rotating stellar-mass BHs can potentially be used
> to place strong bounds on the coupling parameter ℓ of dCS. In order
> for the black hole observed in GRO J1655-40 to be within the
> decoupling limit we need ℓ≲22 km, a value 7 orders of magnitude
> smaller than present Solar System bounds on dynamical Chern-Simons
> gravity.
