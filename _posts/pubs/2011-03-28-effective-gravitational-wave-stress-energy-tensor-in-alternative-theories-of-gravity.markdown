> The inspiral of binary systems in vacuum is controlled by the

> degrees of freedom. For gravitational waves, the dominant
> contribution is characterized by an effective stress-energy tensor
> at future null infinity. We employ perturbation theory and the
> short-wavelength approximation to compute this stress-energy tensor
> in a wide class of alternative theories. We find that this tensor is
> generally a modification of that first computed by Isaacson, where
> the corrections can dominate over the general relativistic term. In
> a wide class of theories, however, these corrections identically
> vanish at asymptotically flat, future, null infinity, reducing the
> stress-energy tensor to Isaacson’s. We exemplify this phenomenon by
> first considering dynamical Chern-Simons modified gravity, which
> corrects the action via a scalar field and the contraction of the
> Riemann tensor and its dual. We then consider a wide class of
> theories with dynamical scalar fields coupled to higher-order
> curvature invariants and show that the gravitational wave
> stress-energy tensor still reduces to Isaacson’s. The calculations
> presented in this paper are crucial to perform systematic tests of
> such modified gravity theories through the orbital decay of binary
> pulsars or through gravitational wave observations.
