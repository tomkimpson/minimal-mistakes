> The so-called corner-turning problem is a major bottleneck for radio
> telescopes with large numbers of antennas. The problem is
> essentially that of rapidly transposing a matrix that is too large
> to store on one single device; in radio interferometry, it occurs
> because data from each antenna need to be routed to an array of
> processors each of which will handle a limited portion of the data
> (say, a frequency range) but requires input from each antenna. We
> present a low-cost solution allowing the correlator to transpose its
> data in real time, without contending for bandwidth, via a butterfly
> network requiring neither additional RAM memory nor expensive
> general-purpose switching hardware. We discuss possible
> implementations of this using FPGA, CMOS, analog logic and optical
> technology, and conclude that the corner-turner cost can be small
> even for upcoming massive radio arrays.
