> star's outer-core, a shell of width (50-95)% of the total radius,
> which corresponds to the density range
> ($$10^{14}-10^{15}$$)g/cm$$^3$$. Second, we 
> study the impact on the universality of approximating stellar
> isodensity contours as self-similar ellipsoids. An analytical
> calculation in the Newtonian limit reveals that the shape of the
> ellipsoids does not affect the universal relations, but relaxing the
> self-similarity assumption can completely destroy it. Third, we
> investigate the eccentricity profiles of rotating relativistic stars
> and find that the ellipticity is roughly constant, with variations
> of roughly (20-30)% in the region that matters to the universal
> relations. Fourth, we repeat the above analysis for non-compact,
> regular stars and find that the ellipticity is not constant, with
> variations that easily exceed 100% and universality is lost. These
> findings suggest that universality arises as an emergent approximate
> symmetry: as one flows in the stellar-structure phase space from
> non-compact star region to the relativistic star region, the
> eccentricity variation inside stars decreases, leading to
> approximate self-similarity in their isodensity contours, which then
> leads to the universal behavior observed in their exterior multipole
