> Autonomous gravitational-wave searches—fully automated analyses of
> data that run without human intervention or assistance—are desirable
> for a number of reasons. They are necessary for the rapid
> identification of gravitational-wave burst candidates, which in turn
> will allow for follow-up observations by other observatories and the
> maximum exploitation of their scientific potential. A fully
> automated analysis would also circumvent the traditional 'by hand'
> setup and tuning of burst searches that is both labourious and time
> consuming. We demonstrate a fully automated search with X-Pipeline,
> a software package for the coherent analysis of data from networks
> of interferometers for detecting bursts associated with gamma-ray
> bursts (GRBs) and other astrophysical triggers. We discuss the
> methods X-Pipeline uses for automated running, including background
> estimation, efficiency studies, unbiased optimal tuning of search
> thresholds and prediction of upper limits. These are all done
> automatically via Monte Carlo with multiple independent data samples
> and without requiring human intervention. As a demonstration of the
> power of this approach, we apply X-Pipeline to LIGO data to compute
> the sensitivity to gravitational-wave emission associated with
> GRB 031108. We find that X-Pipeline is sensitive to signals
> approximately a factor of 2 weaker in amplitude than those
> detectable by the cross-correlation technique used in LIGO searches
> to date. We conclude with comments on the status of X-Pipeline as a
> fully autonomous, near-real-time-triggered burst search in the
> current LSC-Virgo Science Run.
