> One century after its formulation, Einstein's general relativity has
> made remarkable predictions and turned out to be compatible with all
> experimental tests. Most of these tests probe the theory in the
> weak-field regime, and there are theoretical and experimental
> reasons to believe that general relativity should be modified when
> gravitational fields are strong and spacetime curvature is
> large. The best astrophysical laboratories to probe strong-field
> gravity are black holes and neutron stars, whether isolated or in
> binary systems. We review the motivations to consider extensions of
> general relativity. We present a (necessarily incomplete) catalog of
> modified theories of gravity for which strong-field predictions have
> been computed and contrasted to Einstein's theory, and we summarize
> our current understanding of the structure and dynamics of compact
> objects in these theories. We discuss current bounds on modified
> gravity from binary pulsar and cosmological observations, and we
> highlight the potential of future gravitational wave measurements to
> inform us on the behavior of gravity in the strong-field regime.
