> We study isolated and binary neutron stars in dynamical Chern-Simons
> gravity. This theory modifies the Einstein-Hilbert action through
> the introduction of a dynamical scalar field coupled to the
> Pontryagin density. We here treat this theory as an effective model,
> working to leading order in the Chern-Simons coupling. We first
> construct isolated neutron star solutions in the slow-rotation
> expansion to quadratic order in spin. We find that isolated neutron
> stars acquire a scalar dipole charge that corrects its spin angular
> momentum to linear order in spin and corrects its mass and
> quadrupole moment to quadratic order in spin, as measured by an
> observer at spatial infinity. We then consider neutron stars
> binaries that are widely separated and solve for their orbital
> evolution in this modified theory. We find that the evolution of
> post-Keplerian parameters is modified, with the rate of periastron
> advance being the dominant correction at first post-Newtonian
> order. We conclude by applying these results to observed pulsars
> with the aim to place constraints on dynamical Chern-Simons
> gravity. We find that the modifications to the observed mass are
> degenerate with the neutron star equation of state, which prevents
> us from testing the theory with the inferred mass of the millisecond
> pulsar J1614-2230. We also find that the corrections to the
> post-Keplerian parameters are too small to be observable today even
> with data from the double binary pulsar J0737-3039. Our results
> suggest that pulsar observations are not currently capable of
> constraining dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, and thus,
> gravitational-wave observations may be the only path to a stringent
> constraint of this theory in the imminent future.
