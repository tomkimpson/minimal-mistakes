> The gravitational field outside of astrophysical black holes is
> completely described by their mass and spin frequency, as expressed
> by the no-hair theorems. These theorems assume vacuum spacetimes,
> and thus they apply only to black holes and not to stars. Despite
> this, we analytically find that the gravitational potential of
> arbitrarily rapid, rigidly rotating stars can still be described
> completely by only their mass, spin angular momentum, and quadrupole
> moment. Although these results are obtained in the nonrelativistic
> limit (to leading order in a weak-field expansion of general
> relativity, GR), they are also consistent with fully relativistic
> numerical calculations of rotating neutron stars. This description
> of the gravitational potential outside the source in terms of just
> three quantities is approximately universal (independent of equation
> of state). Such universality may be used to break degeneracies in
> pulsar and future gravitational wave observations to extract more
> physics and test GR in the strong-field regime.
