**LISA Consortium Meeting, Marseillie**

First LISA consortium meeting was held this month in the south of France, at the very impressive Palais du Pharo. Lots of interesting stuff, highlights include:
*  Mass-redshift space probed by LISA (see [Figure 3 of this proposal](https://www.elisascience.org/files/publications/LISA_L3_20170120.pdf))LISA should detect massive BH binaries out to redshift ~20.

* The [GRACE-FO mission](https://gracefo.jpl.nasa.gov) using LISA-type technology for Earth observations (can measure mm-level variations in the  Amazon basin!)

* Use of mm-VLBI for EM follow up of binary BH mergers; this is the same as the technology used for the (EHT)[https://eventhorizontelescope.org]. The angular size on the BH at the Galactic centre is approximately that of a 0.05 pc separated binary BH at 10 Gpc.  

* The impact of sub-optimal modelling of EMRI sources. LISA will observe multiple sources simultaneously. The likelihood surface of a single EMRI is very complicated with many local maxima. This becomes additionally complicated if you are looking at multiple sources e.g. how do you distinguish these 10 sources from these 11 sources with difference parameters i.e. a degeneracy problem. The waveforms between source classes are sufficiently different such that this shouldn't be a problem, but within a class this could be problematic.
