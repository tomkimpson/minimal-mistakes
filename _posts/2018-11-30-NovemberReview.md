* LISA Consortium Meeting, Marseillie

First LISA consortium meeting was held this month in the south of France. Lots of interesting stuff. Highlight include mass-redshift space probed by LISA (see [Figure 3 of this proposal](https://www.elisascience.org/files/publications/LISA_L3_20170120.pdf))LISA should detect massive BH binaries out to redshift ~20, the (GRACE-FO mission)[https://gracefo.jpl.nasa.gov] using LISA-type technology for Earth observations (can measure mm-level variations in the  Amazon basin!), use of mm-VLBI for EM follow up of binary BH mergers; this is the same as the technology used for the (EHT)[https://eventhorizontelescope.org]. The angular size on the BH at the Galactic centre is approximately that of a 0.05 pc separated binary BH at 10 Gpc.
