When dealing with large datasets, for all sorts of reasons relating to [accuracy/performance/datasize](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24395686/best-way-to-write-a-large-array-to-file-in-fortran-text-vs-other) we want to do any I/O in binary format.


Two languages I commonly use are Python and Fortran. Getting these two languages to be able to exchange information and talk to each other can be difficult. Binary saved data in Fortran depends on the compiler, whilst the `np.save` function in Python saves in a defined format, but extracting this data in Fortran is a pain.

A useful solution to this problem is to use a hierarchical data format, [HDF](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/).

HDF is especially useful as it allows one to save different types of data in a 'folders and files' format, within one file that can then be read in a platform-independent way. [See here](http://neondataskills.org/HDF5/About) for summary of HDF advantages.

**Installation**

Download the tarball from [HDF](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtainsrc5110.html) and unpack it in some directory, which we will refer to as `HDF5_Dir`.

    cd HDF5_Dir
    ./configure --prefix = HDF5_Dir --enable-fortran
    make
    make check
    make install

for complete details see full [INSTALL_file](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtainsrc5110.html)

If this is all OK, you should be able to navigate to HDF5_Dir/bin and see a executable called h5fc (amongst others). This is the gfortran compiler that we will use when compiling with a view to use HDF5.

The final step is to add the path `HDF5_Dir/bin` to your [bashrc](https://superuser.com/questions/789448/choosing-between-bashrc-profile-bash-profile-etc) file. To do this, simply open bashrc and add

    export PATH = "path/to/dir/HDF5_Dir/bin:$PATH"

Save and reboot terminal.

Now the command

    echo $PATH

should now show `HDF5_Dir/bin` in your `PATH` whilst the command

    h5fc

should bring up a bunch of compilation options.
