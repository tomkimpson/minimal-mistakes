### 2.1 Vectors

We can write a vector with components $$ x^i$$ and basis $$ e_i$$ using **Einstein Summation notation** as

$$ \vec{r} = x^1 \vec{e}_1 + x^2 \vec{e}_2 x^3 \vec{e}_3 = \Sigma_i x^i \vec{e}_i = x^i \vec{e}_i $$

In a coordinate system, basis vectors are tangent to the coordinate lines such that,

$$ \vec{e_a} = \partial_a = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^a}$$

A tensor of type $$ (0,N) $$ is a function which takes $$ N $$ vectors and outputs a real number. If $$ N=1$$, the tensor is a **one form** or **covariant vector** i.e. a one-form is a linear scalar function of a vector.

$$ \tilde V = V_a \omega^a ; \omega^a e_b = \delta_b^a$$

We can transform from one frame to another as (in the covariant case)
