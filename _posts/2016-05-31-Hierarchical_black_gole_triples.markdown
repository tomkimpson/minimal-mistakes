Mergers of compact object binaries are one of the most powerful sources of gravitational waves (GWs) in the frequency range of second-generation ground-based gravitational wave detectors. WE perform N-Body simulations of young dense star clusters (with a new code based on the Mikkola's algorithmic regularization scheme, including the 2.5 post-Newtonian term) to explore the formation of hierarchical triples and the effects of Kozai-Lidov (KL) resonances on the merger rate, with implications for GW events
