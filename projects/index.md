Any non-academic research I refer to as projects. My current main interests are

* Machine Learning. ML refers to teaching a computer to learn concepts without being explicitly programmed. The Quora post ["How do I learn machine learning"](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-machine-learning-1) is an excellent resource, with over 100 answers. For the background theory, Andrew Ng's Stanford course is widely praised and [available free](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) on Coursera. Jason Brownlee also has a nice [collection of resources](http://machinelearningmastery.com/self-study-guide-to-machine-learning/) for progression from Beginner to Advanced.

* Statistics, Game Theory and Probability.

* CompSci 101 - There is a great course free online course from Stanfrod available [here](https://class.coursera.org/cs101-selfservice). Watch this space for notes.
