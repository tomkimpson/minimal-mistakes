I am primarily interested in the dynamics and mergers of compact objects i.e. neutron stars and black holes, which complements an interest in the progenitors and detection of Gamma Ray bursts. These objects provide some of the most agressive and extreme environments in the universe and their mergers are the primary source of detectable gravitational waves with [LIGO](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu)/[VIRGO](http://public.virgo-gw.eu/language/en/), as well as beign the current leading model for the progenitors of short Gamma Ray Bursts.
