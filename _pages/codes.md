Throughout my research I have written a number of scientific codes, typically relating to time-frequency modelling and signal analysis of non-linear, dynamical astrophysical systems (e.g. [Pulsar - Extreme Mass Ratio Binaries](http://tomkimpson.com/research/)).

In order to enable [reproducible research](http://reproducibleresearch.net/) I am attempting to make all codes publicly available with documentation. This endeavour is currently a work in progress.

If you use any of the codes for work resulting in publication, we kindly request you reference the appropriate code and papers. Thanks!
