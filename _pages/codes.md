Throughout my research I have written a number of scientific codes, typically relating to time-frequency modeling and signal analysis of non-linear, dynamical astrophysical systems (e.g. [Pulsar Extreme Mass Ratio Binaries](http://tomkimpson.com/research/)).

In order to enable [reproducible research](http://reproducibleresearch.net/) I am endeavouring to make all codes publicly available with documentation. This endeavour is currently a work in progress.

Please do reference the appropriate code should you use any of the codes for work that result in publication. Thanks!
