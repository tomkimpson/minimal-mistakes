Throughout my research I have written a number of scientific codes, typically relating to time-frequency modelling and signal analysis of non-linear, dynamical astrophysical systems (e.g. [Pulsar - Extreme Mass Ratio Binaries](http://tomkimpson.com/research/)).

In order to enable [reproducible research](http://reproducibleresearch.net/) I am attempting to make all codes associated with published papers publicly available with documentation. This endeavour is currently a work in progress!

If you use any of the codes for work resulting in publication, we kindly request you reference the appropriate code and papers. Thanks!

* [Iliad](https://github.com/tomkimpson/Iliad). Theoretical, computational modelling of the electromagnetic time-frequency signal from a pulsar orbiting a massive BH, subject to all relativistic and astrophysical effects. Public release in progress.

* [GW_Bursts](https://github.com/tomkimpson/GW_Bursts). Gravitational waveform modelling from extreme mass ratio binaries.

* [ForwardRayTracing](https://github.com/tomkimpson/ForwardRayTracing). Ray Tracing in a curved Kerr spacetime from a moving relativistic source.

* [SpinCurvatureDynamics](https://github.com/tomkimpson/SpinCurvatureDynamics). Modelling the complex spin-orbital dynamics of an extended spinning body (e.g. a pulsar) in a curved, Kerr spacetime.

* [QuadrupoleSpinCurvatureDynamics](https://github.com/tomkimpson/QuadrupoleSpinCurvatureDynamics). Spin-Orbital dynamics around a quasi-Kerr black hole with an arbitrary mass quadrupole.
