My research primarily involves investigating Pulsar-Black Hole binary systems. These objects provide the most aggressive and extreme environments in the universe and are the perfect testing ground for general relativity in the strong-field regime.

Recent gravitational wave detections by the ground based [LIGO detector](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu)/[VIRGO](http://public.virgo-gw.eu/language/en/) combined with upcoming radio facilities like [SKA](https://www.skatelescope.org) and space based gravitational wave detectors such as [eLISA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tZOX7bBkvE) make this an especially exciting time to investigate general relativity with multi-messenger methods in the strong-field regime.

My research involves theoretically investigating the detectability of PSR-BH systems and how they can be used to test strong-field GR. To this end my current work involves investigating the convolution of gravitational and relativistic effects with electromagnetic plasma effects and also how a PSR-BH signal would behave in a time-frequency domain.
