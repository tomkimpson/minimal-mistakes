I am primarily interested in the dynamics and mergers of compact objects, i.e. neutron stars and black holes. These objects provide the most aggressive and extreme environments in the universe and are the perfect testing ground for general relativity in the strong-field regime. 

My current research involves theoretically investigating the complex dynamics of strong-gravity systems via numerical methods in general relativity. Spinning, finite objects would not follow geodesics in the space-time manifold due ot spin-curvature coupling and consequently such systems exhibit complex behaviours.

Recent gravitational wave detections by the ground based [LIGO detector](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu)/[VIRGO](http://public.virgo-gw.eu/language/en/) combined with upcoming radio facilities like [SKA](https://www.skatelescope.org) and space based gravitaional wave detectors such as [eLISA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tZOX7bBkvE) make this an especially exciting time to investigate general relativity in the strong-field regime.
