I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Physics at [MSSL, UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl) undertaking research in the [Astrophysics group](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/astro) with [Kinwah Wu](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=KWUXX50). I graduated from Durham in 2016 with an MPhys in Physics and Astronomy, having worked in the [VHE Gammma Ray group](https://www.dur.ac.uk/cfai/vhegammaraygroup/). I have also have also worked with the [ForDyS Group](http://web.pd.astro.it/mapelli/group.html) of INAF, Padova, where I collaborated on the merger of compact object binaries and triples using N-Body simulations and worked for start-up [Pace](https://www.paceup.com/en/)(n$\acute{e}$e Prix) using machine learning methods for dynamic pricing and revenue management.
