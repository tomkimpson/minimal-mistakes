I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Physics at [MSSL, UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl) undertaking research in the [Astrophysics group](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/astro) with (Kinwah Wu)[https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=KWUXX50]. I graduated from Durham in 2016 with an MPhys in Physics and Astronomy, having worked in the [Very High Energy Astrophysics group](https://www.dur.ac.uk/cfai/vhegammaraygroup/). I have also have also worked with the [ForDyS Group](http://web.pd.astro.it/mapelli/group.html) of INAF, Padova, where I collaborated on the merger of compact object binaries and triples using N-Body simulations and worked for start-up [PRIX](http://www.prix.ai) using machine learning methods for dynamic pricing and revenue management.<br> <br>

My Ph.D. research concerns the dynamics and radiation of  Pulsar-Black Hole, and how we can use these systems to further understand gravity in the strong-field regime. For more info see the [Research Page](http://tomkimpson.com/research/) <br> <br>

This blog serves as a platform for scientific outreach posts, primarily relating to general relativity - our current leading theory of gravity. Some posts are more technical and aimed at those with a more mathematical background, while others should be more widely understandable. I find that these posts are also personally helpful for exposing any of my own misunderstandings. There are also some short technical computing notes that may be useful as a reference to myself or others.
