Here is a collection of links you may find useful. If there are some
links you think ought to be here, feel free to suggest them to me.

# Physics #

* [Gravitational-wave resources](http://www.astro.cornell.edu/~favata/gwresources.html) list from [Marc Favata](http://www.astro.cornell.edu/~favata/)
* [Hyperspace list](http://hyperspace.uni-frankfurt.de/) of
  gravity conferences and jobs
* [Physics research conference (PRC) calendar](http://www.pmaweb.caltech.edu/PhysColl/PhysColl15-16.html) at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/)
* [TAPIR seminar calendar](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/seminars/) (I am an
  organizer)

# Papers #

* [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/) preprints service. I typically read:
  * [gr-qc](http://arxiv.org/list/gr-qc/new),
  * [hep-th](http://arxiv.org/list/hep-th/new),
  * [astro-ph](http://arxiv.org/list/astro-ph/new)
* [INSPIRE](http://inspirehep.net/) system
  * [My papers on INSPIRE](http://inspirehep.net/search?p=exactauthor%3AL.C.Stein.2)
* [NASA ADS](http://labs.adsabs.harvard.edu/adsabs/) service

# Software #

* [arXiv keys](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/arxiv-keys/fkjjdlbhliopfhgddlpoggpmpgjfaojd):
  I wanted keyboard navigation on the arXiv so I made this extension
  for Chrome. Find the source at
  [arXiv-keys on github](https://github.com/duetosymmetry/arXiv-keys).
* [xAct/xTensor](http://xact.es/): I make xTensive use of (and have
  contributed to) this system for abstract and component tensor math
  in Mathematica.
  * [Community-contributed packages](http://contrib.xact.es/) for
     xAct.
  * [xTerior](https://github.com/xAct-contrib/xTerior): I coauthored
    this package for exterior differential geometry
* I use [Aquamacs](http://aquamacs.org/)
  [emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) for <s>writing</s>
  everything.
* [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/)
  * [AUCTeX](https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/) makes writing LaTeX
  in emacs better.
  * [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/);
    [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/)
  * Make sure you use [pdfsync](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/pdfsync). It
    works with [Skim.app](http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/), which is
    a better PDF reader than Apple's Preview.app.
* [git](http://git-scm.com/): I recommend using git for revision control
  * [Leo C. Stein on github](https://github.com/duetosymmetry)
  * [This web page's repo](https://github.com/duetosymmetry/web-site)
* [make-iop-author-list](https://github.com/duetosymmetry/make-iop-author-list): If you find yourself in the unenviable position of needing to create
  a long LaTeX author list for an IOP publication, then you don't get
  nice `\affiliation{}` macros (like in revtex, for example) to do the
  work for you. Therefore try this script.
* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/): This web site was made using Jekyll.

# Other #

* [Digital library of mathematical functions](http://dlmf.nist.gov)
  (DLMF): This NIST reference replaces Abromowitz and Stegun.
* [Astrophysics jobs rumor mill](http://www.astrobetter.com/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=Rumor+Mill)
  wiki.
