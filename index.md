I am currently a PhD candidate at [MSSL, UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl) undertaking research in the [Astrophysics group](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/astro). My research is in theoretical astrophysics, primarily on general relativity and in particular the relativistic factors which relate to the detection of pulsars in the Galactic centre and the inner regions of globular clusters, and the use of these systems to test fundamental physics. <br> <br>
