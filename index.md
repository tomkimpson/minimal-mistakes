I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Physics at [MSSL, UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl) undertaking research in the [Astrophysics group](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/astro) with [Kinwah Wu](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=KWUXX50). I graduated from Durham in 2016 with an MPhys in Physics and Astronomy, having worked in the [VHE Gammma Ray group](https://www.dur.ac.uk/cfai/vhegammaraygroup/). I have also have also worked with the [ForDyS Group](http://web.pd.astro.it/mapelli/group.html) of INAF, Padova, where I collaborated on the merger of compact object binaries and triples using N-Body simulations and worked for start-up [PRIX](http://www.prix.ai) using machine learning methods for dynamic pricing and revenue management.

My Ph.D. research concerns the dynamics and radiation of  Pulsar-Black Hole, and how we can use these systems to further understand gravity in the strong-field regime. For more info see the [Research Page](http://tomkimpson.com/research/).

This blog serves as a platform for scientific outreach posts, primarily relating to general relativity - our current leading theory of gravity. Some posts are more technical and aimed at those with a more mathematical background, while others should be more widely understandable. These posts are also personally helpful in developing my own writing style and exposing any of my own misunderstandings.

There are also some short technical computing notes that may be useful as a reference to myself or others.
