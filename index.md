I am currently a PhD candidate at [MSSL, UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl) undertaking research in the [Astrophysics group](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/astro). <br> <br>
My research is in theoretical astrophysics, primarily on general relativity and in particular the relativistic factors which relate to the detection of pulsars in the Galactic centre and the inner regions of globular clusters, and the use of these systems to test fundamental physics. <br> <br>
For a more detailed outline of my research interests, please see my [research page](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl). For recent publications see my You can also see my [publications page](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl) for a list of my relevant publications. You can also find a [short CV](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl) and a miscellaneous [collection of links](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl)
