I am a theoretical astrophysicist currently undertaking research for my PhD at [MSSL, UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl) within the [Astrophysics group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/research/astrophysics). 

My primary research interest is in testing [General Relativity](https://xkcd.com/1158/) in the strong-field regime. To this end, I use Extreme Mass Ratio Pulsar-Black Hole systems which are thought to occur in the Galactic centre and the inner regions of globular clusters. My thesis research is concerned with the theoretical modelling of the electromagnetic signals for these systems in order to be able to use them as probes of fundamental physics and astrophysics. For more information see [my research page](http://tomkimpson.com/research/).

I am also a member of the [LISA Consortium](https://www.lisamission.org/articles/lisa-consortium). LISA will be the first space-based gravitational wave detector, accessing a frequency range that is inaccessible to ground based detectors. I am particularly interested in the dynamics and gravitational radiation from so-called ['EMRIs'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_mass_ratio_inspiral) and the use of these systems to answer deep questions around General Relativity.
