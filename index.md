I am currently a PhD candidate at [MSSL, UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl) undertaking research in the [Astrophysics group](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/astro). <br> <br>
My research is in theoretical astrophysics, primarily on general relativity and in particular the relativistic factors which relate to the detection of Pulsar-Black Hole systems in the Galactic centre and the inner regions of globular clusters, and the use of these systems to test fundamental physics in extreme environments. <br> <br>
For a more detailed outline of my research interests, please see my [research page](http://tomkimpson.com/research/). See the [publications page](http://tomkimpson.com/pubs/) for a list of my relevant publications. You can also find a [short CV](http://tomkimpson.com/about/), a miscellaneous [collection of resources](http://tomkimpson.com/links/), an outsourcing of my memory into [weekly digest posts](http://tomkimpson.com/categories/) on anything interesting (non-physics) I come across, and some short [posts/notes](http://tomkimpson.com/posts/) that may be useful as a reference to myself or others.
