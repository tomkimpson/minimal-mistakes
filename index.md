I am an physics student,having recently (June 2016) completed an MPhys at Durham, researching gamma ray bursts in the high-energy astro department. In September 2016 I will be starting a PhD in astrophysics at [MSSL, UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/astro), investigating spinning objects in strong gravity (i.e. fast spinning Neutron star and Black holes in binary or triple systems). I am also a member of the [ForDyS Group](http://web.pd.astro.it/mapelli/group.html) of INAF, Padova, where I have collaborated on a the merger of compact object binaries and triples using N-Body simulations. 

    This site will serve as a repo to centralise any projects or things I have learned. I have recently transferred over from a Pelican/Python framework to using Ruby/Jekyll. Consequently many pages and posts are still only half-working, so please bear with. It is likely that I will frequently be tinkering with the code so if something doesn't work do let me know.
