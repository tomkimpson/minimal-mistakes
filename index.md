I am a theoretical astrophysicist currently undertaking research for my PhD at [MSSL, UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl) within the [Astrophysics group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/research/astrophysics). 


My primary research interests are in the multimessenger astrophysics of compact objects (especially pulsars) in Extreme/Intermediate mass ratio binaries and the use of these systems to explore deep questions in fundamental physics (cf. strong field GR) and astrophysics. Please see [my research page](http://tomkimpson.com/research/) for more information.
