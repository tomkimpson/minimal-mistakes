I am a theoretical astrophysicist currently undertaking research for my PhD at [MSSL, UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl) within the [Astrophysics group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/research/astrophysics). <br> <br>

My research is in theoretical astrophysics, primarily on general relativity and in particular the relativistic factors which relate to the detection of Pulsar-Black Hole systems in the Galactic centre and the inner regions of globular clusters, and the use of these systems to test fundamental physics in the strong-field regime. For more information see [my research page](http://tomkimpson.com/research/) <br> <br>

I am also a member of the [LISA Consortium](https://www.lisamission.org/articles/lisa-consortium). LISA will be the first space-based gravitational wave detector, accessing a frequency range that is inaccessible to ground based detectors. I am particularly interested in the gravitational radiation from so-called ['EMRIs'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_mass_ratio_inspiral) and the use of these systems to answer key questions of fundamental physics and astrophysics.
