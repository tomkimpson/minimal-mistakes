I am currently a PhD candidate at [MSSL, UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl) undertaking research in the [Astrophysics group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/research/astrophysics). <br> <br>
My research is in theoretical astrophysics, primarily on general relativity and in particular the relativistic factors which relate to the detection of Pulsar-Black Hole systems in the Galactic centre and the inner regions of globular clusters, and the use of these systems to test fundamental physics in extreme environments. <br> <br>
