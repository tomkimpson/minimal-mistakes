I am a theoretical astrophysicist currently undertaking research for my PhD at [MSSL, UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl) within the [Astrophysics group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/research/astrophysics). 

My primary research interest is in testing [general relativity](https://xkcd.com/1158/) in the strong-field regime. To this end, I investigate the relativistic factors which relate to the detection of pulsar-Black Hole systems in the Galactic centre and the inner regions of globular clusters, and the use of these systems to test fundamental physics in extreme environments. For more information see [my research page](http://tomkimpson.com/research/).

I am also a member of the [LISA Consortium](https://www.lisamission.org/articles/lisa-consortium). LISA will be the first space-based gravitational wave detector, accessing a frequency range that is inaccessible to ground based detectors. I am particularly interested in the gravitational radiation from so-called ['EMRIs'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_mass_ratio_inspiral) and the use of these systems to answer key questions of fundamental physics and astrophysics.
