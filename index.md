I am currently (or rather, will shortly be) a Ph.D. cadidate in Physics at [MSSL, UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl) undertaking research in the [Astrophysics group](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/astro). <br> <br>
My Ph.D. research concerns the complex dynamics exhibitied by black-hole - neutron star systems in strong gravity. Such spinning objects would not follow geodesics in the space-time manifold and exhibit interesting and complex spin and dynamical behaviours due to general relativistic effects.<br> <br>
I recieved my Masters in Physics and Astronomy from Durham University in 2016. My Master's thesis research involved researching gamma ray bursts in the [Very High Energy Astro department](https://www.dur.ac.uk/cfai/vhegammaraygroup/), investigating the detectability of GRB's by the upcoming [CTA](https://portal.cta-observatory.org/Pages/Home.aspx), in addition to the radiation mechanisms present in GRBs.<br> <br>
I have also worked with the [ForDyS Group](http://web.pd.astro.it/mapelli/group.html) of INAF, Padova, where I have collaborated on the merger of compact object binaries and triples using N-Body simulations. More recently, I have worked for the start-up [PRIX](http://www.prix.ai) using machine learning methods for dynamic pricing and revenue management.
