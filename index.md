I am a theoretical astrophysicist undertaking research for my PhD at [MSSL, UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl) within the [Astrophysics group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/research/astrophysics). I am currently working at the [Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/) as a Visiting Graduate Fellow.


My primary research interests are in the multimessenger astrophysics of compact objects ([especially pulsars!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjLk_72V9Bw)) in Extreme Mass Ratio Binaries - for example a pulsar orbiting the [supermassive black hole at the Galactic centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Center#Supermassive_black_hole).

 In particular, I am interested and the use of these systems to explore deep questions in fundamental physics (cf. strong-field general relativity) and astrophysics. Please see [my research page](http://tomkimpson.com/research/) for more information.
