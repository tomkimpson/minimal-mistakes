Hello.

I am an astrophysics student,having recently (June 2016) completed an MPhys at Durham, researching gamma ray bursts in the high-energy astro department. In September 2016 I will be starting a PhD at MSSL, UCL, investigating spinning objects in strong gravity (i.e. fast spinning Neutron star and Black holes in binary or triple systems). I am also a member of the <span style="color:rgb(51, 153, 255)"><a href="http://web.pd.astro.it/mapelli/group.html">ForDyS</a></span> of the INAF, Padova, where I collaborate on a the merger of compact object binaries and triples using N-Body simulations.

This site will serve as a repo to centralise any projects or things I have learned. It is also a good excuse to play with and improve my Ruby/Jekyll/HTML skills. It is likely that I will frequently be tinkering with the code so if something doesn't work do let me know.
