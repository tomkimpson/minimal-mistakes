I am currently a PhD candidate at [MSSL, UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl) undertaking research in the [Astrophysics group](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/astro). <br> <br>
My research is in theoretical astrophysics, primarily on general relativity and in particular the relativistic factors which relate to the detection of pulsars in the Galactic centre and the inner regions of globular clusters, and the use of these systems to test fundamental physics. <br> <br>
For a more detailed outline of my research interests, please see my [research page](http://tomkimpson.com/research/). For recent publications see my You can also see my [publications page](http://tomkimpson.com/pubs/) for a list of my relevant publications. You can also find a [short CV](http://tomkimpson.com/about/) and a miscellaneous [collection of links](http://tomkimpson.com/links/)

My Ph.D. research concerns the dynamics and radiation of  Pulsar-Black Hole, and how we can use these systems to further understand gravity in the strong-field regime. For more info see the [Research Page](http://tomkimpson.com/research/).

This blog serves as a platform for scientific outreach posts, primarily relating to general relativity - our current leading theory of gravity. Some posts are more technical and aimed at those with a more mathematical background, while others should be more widely understandable. These posts are also personally helpful in developing my own writing style and exposing any of my own misunderstandings.

There are also some short technical computing notes that may be useful as a reference to myself or others.
